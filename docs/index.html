<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">3.1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief introduction</a><a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Besides Earth’s universe, there are other parallel universes that exist in the multiverse, including Vardaellen’s one. It is a place filled with incredible creatures, powerful magic, and deities that directly affect the lives of many. Vardaellen is the 3rd closest planet to the sun in its solar system - one among uncountable other systems located in one of uncountable galaxies.
The universe itself in a plane plane of existence called the Material Plane that coexist with others (as described in <a class="reference internal" href="#the-whole-vardaellen-campaign-setting-s-planes">The Whole (Vardaellen Campaign Setting’s planes)</a>). Material planes are mostly governed by rules concerning time, space and gravity similar to the ones in the world where we live earthly lives.
In terms of technology, Vardaellen resembles our Earth during the Middle Ages - so, even if, for clarification, we talk about solar systems and multiverses, those concepts are probably still unknown most if not all of the Vardaellen’s races.</p>
<div class="section" id="origin-of-the-word-vardaellen">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">3.1.1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Origin of the word Vardaellen</a><a class="headerlink" href="#origin-of-the-word-vardaellen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most people believe that the origin of the word Vardaellen was lost along the ages. A single, hardly believable, tale, however, still remains, as related below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Vardaellen: an anagram of vanilla (without the ‘i’) and Erde (without the d)</strong></p>
<p>A powerful dimensional traveler from a planet called Earth from an alternative universe, ages ago, came to visit our world and learn about our people.
He was surprised to know that the natives, that at that time had just discovered the alphabet, didn’t have a word to name their world.
To solve the problem, the traveler consulted a magical, rectangular, shining oracle (that, despite its incredible power, was small enough to be held and used with a single hand when he wanted to ask for premonitions and advice). A female voice emanated from the oracle, speaking the words “Vanilla” and “Erde”. The second word was unknown to the natives, so the traveler explained: that’s German for “Earth” (the Germans, he later explained, were a tribe that inhabited his planet). By joining those words he forged “Vardaellen” and, surprisingly, the name ended up being adopted by most (if not all) of the intelligent races. Even extra-planar creatures use the name, a possible sign that this very same traveler visited many other places and planes, spreading it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-whole-vardaellen-campaign-setting-s-planes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">3.2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whole (Vardaellen Campaign Setting’s planes)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-whole-vardaellen-campaign-setting-s-planes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are vast realms that exist beyond the Material Plane and the Vardaellen where humans, elves, dwarves, orcs and other races fight their wars and live their mundane lives.
Collectively known as “The Planes”, they form a vast system of continent-like masses that either float above the waters of the Astral Plane (the Outter Planes), or exist inside of it (The Inner Sphere). Because the Astral Plane resembles an actual ocean, it is somethings called Astral Ocean.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-inner-sphere">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">3.2.1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inner Sphere</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-inner-sphere" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><span class="raw-html"><a href="_static/art/inner.jpg"><figure><img alt="The Inner Sphere" name="optionalImages" src="_static/art/inner_thumb.jpg" /><figcaption>Image: The Inner Sphere.</figcaption></figure></a></span></p>
<p>At the depths of the Astral Ocean, The Inner Sphere is a irregular sphere, filled with a fog-like substance - The Ethereal Plane. At is outermost area, the Ethereal Plane takes a more solid form, resembling a plasma or glue, barring the Astral Plane from completely filling the Inner Sphere. At its innermost part, the Ethereal Plane takes a form that more closely resembles a fog.
Located at the heart of the Inner, the Material plane coexists with its twisted reflection, Shadow Plane. Surrounding them are the elemental planes (air, earth, fire, and water) and the energy planes (negative and positive), resembling moons orbiting a planet.</p>
<p>The planes are briefly detailed below.</p>
<div class="section" id="ethereal-plane">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">3.2.1.1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereal Plane</a><a class="headerlink" href="#ethereal-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as well. The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct; colors blur into each other and edges are fuzzy.</p>
<p>While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the latter is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, insubstantial, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane.</p>
<p>The Ethereal Plane has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>No Gravity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alterable Morphic</strong>: The plane contains little to alter, however.</li>
<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>
<li><strong>Normal Magic</strong>: Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane. The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings; these can cross from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane. Spellcasters on the Material Plane must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based spells. While it’s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force spell cast on the Material Plane, the reverse isn’t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane, including force attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">3.2.1.2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Material Plane</a><a class="headerlink" href="#material-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Material Plane is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered normal. It is the plane most campaign worlds occupy.</p>
<p>The Material Plane has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Normal Gravity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Normal Time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Alterable Morphic</strong></li>
<li><strong>No Elemental or Energy Traits</strong>: Specific locations may have these traits, however.</li>
<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong>: Though it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.</li>
<li><strong>Normal Magic</strong></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shadow-plane">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">3.2.1.3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Plane</a><a class="headerlink" href="#shadow-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Shadow Plane is a dimly lit dimension that is both coterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane. It overlaps the Material Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, so a planar traveler can use the Shadow Plane to cover great distances quickly. The Shadow Plane is also coterminous to other planes. With the right spell, a character can use the Shadow Plane to visit other realities. The Shadow Plane is a world of black and white; color itself has been bleached from the environment. It otherwise appears similar to the Material Plane. Despite the lack of light sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call the Shadow Plane home.</p>
<p>The Shadow Plane has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Magically Morphic</strong>: Parts of the Shadow Plane continually flow onto other planes. As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks. In addition, certain spells, such as shadow conjuration and shadow evocation, modify the base material of the Shadow Plane. The utility and power of these spells within the Shadow Plane make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.</li>
<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells with the shadow descriptor are enhanced on the Shadow Plane. Furthermore, specific spells become more powerful on the Shadow Plane. Shadow conjuration and shadow evocation spells are 30% as powerful as the conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed to 20%). Greater shadow conjuration and greater shadow evocation are 70% as powerful (not 60%), and a shades spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not 80%). Despite the dark nature of the Shadow Plane, spells that produce, use, or manipulate darkness are unaffected by the plane.</li>
<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells with the light descriptor or that use or generate light or fire are impeded on the Shadow Plane. Spells that produce light are less effective in general, because all light sources have their ranges halved on the Shadow Plane.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="negative-energy-plane">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">3.2.1.4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Negative Energy Plane</a><a class="headerlink" href="#negative-energy-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To an observer, there’s little to see on the Negative Energy Plane. It is a dark, empty place, an eternal pit where a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all light and life. The Negative Energy Plane is the most hostile of the Inner Planes, the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to its life-draining energies can survive there.</p>
<p>The Negative Energy Plane has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Major Negative-Dominant</strong>: Some areas within the plane have only the minor negative-dominant trait, and these islands tend to be inhabited.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are enhanced. Class abilities that use negative energy, such as channel negative energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</li>
<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy (including cure spells) are impeded. Characters on this plane take a –10 penalty on saving throws made to remove negative levels bestowed by an energy drain attack.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="positive-energy-plane">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">3.2.1.5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive Energy Plane</a><a class="headerlink" href="#positive-energy-plane" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Positive Energy Plane has no surface and is akin to the Plane of Air with its wide-open nature. However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which are not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of the Inner Planes. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive energy is forced upon her. Then, because her mortal frame is unable to contain that power, she is immolated, like a mote of dust caught at the edge of a supernova. Visits to the Positive Energy Plane are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily protected.</p>
<p>The Positive Energy Plane has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Major Positive-Dominant</strong>: Some regions of the plane have the minor positive-dominant trait instead, and those islands tend to be inhabited.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are enhanced. Class abilities that use positive energy, such as channel positive energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</li>
<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy (including inflict spells) are impeded.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">3.2.1.6-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plane of Air</a><a class="headerlink" href="#plane-of-air" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Plane of Air is an empty plane, consisting of sky above and sky below. It is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner Planes and is the home of all manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While travelers without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The Plane of Air has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong>: Inhabitants of the plane determine their own “down” direction. Objects not under the motive force of others do not move.</li>
<li><strong>Air-Dominant</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the air descriptor or that use, manipulate, or create air (including those of the Air domain and the elemental [air] bloodline) are enhanced.</li>
<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the earth descriptor or that use or create earth (including those of the Earth domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental [earth] bloodline, and spells that summon earth elementals or outsiders with the earth subtype) are impeded.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Plane of Earth is a solid place made of soil and stone. An unwary traveler might find himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and crushed into nothingness, with his powdered remains left as a warning to any foolish enough to follow. Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the Plane of Earth is varied in its consistency, ranging from soft soil to veins of heavier and more valuable metal.</p>
<p>The Plane of Earth has the following traits:</p>

<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Earth-Dominant</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the earth descriptor or that use, manipulate, or create earth or stone (including those of the Earth domain and the elemental [earth] bloodline) are enhanced.</li>
<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the air descriptor or that use or create air (including those of the Air domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental [air] bloodline, and spells that summon air elementals or outsiders with the air subtype) are impeded.</li>

<p>Everything is alight on the Plane of Fire. The ground is nothing more than great, ever-shifting plates of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms and the most common liquid is magma. The oceans are made of liquid flame, and the mountains ooze with molten lava. Fire survives here without needing fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily.</p>

<p>The Plane of Water is a sea without a floor or a surface, an entirely fluid environment lit by a diffuse glow. It is one of the more hospitable of the Inner Planes once a traveler gets past the problem of breathing the local medium.</p>
<p>The eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, and between saline and fresh. They are perpetually in motion, wracked by currents and tides.</p>
<p>The plane’s permanent settlements form around bits of flotsam suspended within this endless liquid, drifting on the tides.</p>

<p>Although endless, to the eyes of mortals, The Whole if often considered to have a sphere-like shape. For that reason, the outermost planes are collectively known as The Outer Sphere. When referring to the Astral Plane and the planes above it, the name Outer Sphere is preferably used, while, to refer to only the planes that exist above the Astral Ocean, the name Outer Planes is preferred.</p>

<p>The Astral Plane is the space between the Inner Sphere and the Outer Planes, and coterminous with all of the planes. When a character moves through a portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane briefly touch the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane is a great, endless expanse of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p>
<p>The Astral Plane has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Timeless</strong>: Age, hunger, thirst, afflictions (such as diseases, curses, and poisons), and natural healing don’t function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane.</li>
<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be employed as if they were improved by the Quicken Spell or Quicken Spell-Like Ability feats. Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell or spell-like ability can be cast per round.</li>

<p>A plane of the purest good. Here the Middle Path between chaos and order is walked to achieve the greater good.</p>
<p>The plane of Nirvana consist of tectonic-like plates, varying from small to continental sizes, floating along the central northern part of the Astral Ocean.
Its weather is diverse, varying from the tropical-like weather of its southern part, the Nirvana Shores, passing through a subtropical zone, a temperate zone and finally a cold one, the Arctic Nirvana, at its northern part. One could say that Nirvana looks like a whole hemisphere of Vardaellen.
That allows the plane of Nirvana to have a representation of every single vardaellenian biome, with its respective fauna and flora.
In terms of variety, it even surpasses the wildlife of the Elysium, but not in numbers, for even the wildlife population in Nirvana is moderate.
Spread amongst each of those biomes there are small monasteries where those that follow the Way of the Middle Path live - proving that the Enlightenment and Good can be obtained no matter where.</p>

<p>A plane of good and freedom. Artistry and creativity flourish at the taverns of Dionysia, the Capital of Arts - the dream of every bard.
Outside of the city, wildlife thrives, either on the deep jungles and forest or on the many rivers that cross the Elysium. Even the Astral Ocean, when near the Coast of Elysium, assumes characteristics closer to those of the Material Plane’s oceans, and becomes filled with life.
Some of the greatest jungles and forests of Elysium and Nirvana are spread across the frontier between those two planes, each one occupying areas that would make the greatest of the vardaellenian forests pale in comparison.</p>

<p>Covering both the southern and eastern borders of Olympus, the Golden Hall’s also function as a huge wall, forcing eventual invasors from other planes to have to fight those who there keep guard before ever having the chance to bother the gods of Olympus.
The Golden Hall is home to the legendary heroes of the past, those that, coming from all planes, worlds and races, proved themselves in battle and performed epic deeds during their lives.
All day long they fight one another, practicing, performing epic battles, becoming stronger than they could ever be while alive. And every night their wounds are healed, their health fully recovered and they’re served feasts worthy of the gods themselves.
Among those heroes, the ones that prove themselves to also be faithful followers (and pleasant company) receive the privilege of joining their deities for eventual private feasts or, even more, actually becoming part of its permanent guard.</p>

<p>A place of ultimate chaos, the Entropy is an ever-changing plane, completely unpredictable and extremely dangerous for most living beings - even immortal ones.
Dark and cold, the Entropy resembles the outer space where each of the six basic building blocks of the universe (Positive Energy, Negative Energy, Air, Earth, Fire, and Water) are present as separate masses that change their form.
Each of these bodies absorbs its own kind of matter and contracts itself down to the size of a small coin. When it becomes unsustainable to contain such amounts of matter in such a small body, they explode, releasing their matter all around Entropy, only to start the process all over again.
One Myth of Creation, says that all of the planes and the known universe was created from Entropy.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>In the beginning, there was Chaos and there were the Old Gods. Apart from themselves and the infinite contraction cycle of the primal matters, everything was empty, silent, endless, dark. There was no one to worship, serve or entertain them, so they created the other forms of life. But there was nowhere they could live, for the Entropy itself would destroy their creations soon after they became to exist. So the Old Gods created the planes and the universe. And then they constrained the Entropy to a single one of these planes. Their creations could now be placed in places suitable for them to live and worship them.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>The colossal task of first, creating, and then, sustaining life and the universe requires the Gods to invest a considerable part of their power. Trough worship they were able to regain part of it back, but that also created the possibility of one god surpassing others in power, as long as they could convert some of their followers.
If the Gods of Old were equal in power, the Gods of our time present a great disparity of power between them. Some of those Gods, failing to maintain their worshipers, became no more than a shadow of their former selves and are now even called “Demi-God”.</p>
<p>After the infinite Void was contained into a single, limited plane, the Entropy acquired the form of a sea of chaos, where the Proteans - the life form created to live in the Entropy itself - now live, dreaming of restoring their home to its former infinitude. Living with the canvas of reality itself within their reach, they even learned to manipulate it to a minor extent and create some things on their own. The one god that created the Proteans, whose name has now been completely forgotten, is said to, after so millennia living in the Entropy, ended up becoming one with it, a living aspect of Entropy itself.</p>
<p>Entropy has the following traits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity and Normal Gravity</strong>: On the few islands of stability within Entropy, gravity is more likely to be normal (down is toward the center of mass). Everywhere else, gravity is subjective directional.</li>
<li><strong>Erratic Time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Highly Morphic</strong></li>
<li><strong>Strongly Chaos-Aligned</strong></li>

<p>The other planes of existence are vast realms that exist beyond the the Material Plane. Collectively known as The Whole, they are often called simply The Planes.
Almost limitless in size and potential, the various planes embody the fundamental aspects of reality: alignments, elements, energies, and so on. Each plane is a universe unto itself: it follows its own natural laws and has its own unique inhabitants — the outsiders that occasionally visit or are summoned to the mortal world, be they gods, angels, demons, devils, or even stranger creatures.
Literally, anything is possible on the planes, making them a perfect location for exotic, terrifying, wondrous, and deadly adventures.</p>

<p><strong>Material Plane</strong>: The <a class="reference internal" href="#material-plane">Material Plane</a> is the most Earthlike of all the planes, and operates under the same set of natural laws that our own world does. This is the default plane for most adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Transitive Planes</strong>: These three planes have one important common characteristic: each is used to get from one place to another. The <a class="reference internal" href="#astral-plane">Astral Plane</a> (although technically an Outer Plane) is a conduit to all other planes, while the <a class="reference internal" href="#ethereal-plane">Ethereal Plane</a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="#shadow-plane">Shadow Plane</a> both serve as means of transportation within the Material Plane, which they’re connected to. These planes have the strongest regular interaction with the Material Plane and can be accessed using various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.</p>
<p><strong>Demiplanes</strong>: This catch-all category covers all extradimensional spaces that function like planes, but have measurable size and limited access. Those can be as large as any of the inner or outer planes, or as small as a vardaellenian hut.</p>
<p><strong>Inner Planes</strong>: These six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the universe. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or element as the plane itself. The <a class="reference internal" href="#negative-energy-plane">Negative Energy Plane</a>, the <a class="reference internal" href="#positive-energy-plane">Positive Energy Plane</a>, the <a class="reference internal" href="#plane-of-air">Plane of Air</a>, the <a class="reference internal" href="#plane-of-earth">Plane of Earth</a>, the <a class="reference internal" href="#plane-of-fire">Plane of Fire</a>, and the <a class="reference internal" href="#plane-of-water">Plane of Water</a> are all Inner Planes.</p>
<p><strong>Outer Planes</strong>: The deities live on the Outer Planes, as do creatures such as celestials, fiends, and other outsiders. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment representing a particular moral or ethical outlook:</p>

<p>Each plane of existence has its own properties—the natural laws of its universe. Planar traits are broken down into a number of general areas. All planes have the following kinds of traits.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Traits</strong>: These traits determine the laws of physics and nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental and Energy Traits</strong>: The dominance of particular elemental or energy forces is determined by these traits.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment Traits</strong>: Just as characters may be lawful neutral or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular morality or ethos.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Traits</strong>: Magic works differently from plane to plane; magic traits set the boundaries for what magic can and can’t do on each plane.</p>
<div class="section" id="physical-traits">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id57">4.1.1.1.1-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical Traits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#physical-traits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The two most important natural laws set by physical traits are how gravity works and how time passes. Other physical traits pertain to the size and shape of a plane and how easily a plane’s nature can be altered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gravity">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id58">4.1.1.1.2-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravity</a><a class="headerlink" href="#gravity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The direction of gravity’s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the plane itself.</p>
<p><strong>Normal Gravity</strong>: Most planes have gravity similar to that of the Material Plane. The usual rules for ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance applies. Unless otherwise noted in a plane’s description, assume that it has the normal gravity trait.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Gravity</strong>: The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, and Swim checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character’s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character’s Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters that fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for every 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.</p>
<p><strong>Light Gravity</strong>: The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls and on Acrobatics and Ride checks. All items weigh half as much, and weapon ranges double. Strength and Dexterity don’t change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives. Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for every 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d4).</p>
<p><strong>No Gravity</strong>: Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources are available to provide a direction for gravity’s pull.</p>
<p><strong>Objective Directional Gravity</strong>: The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional “down” toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the plane itself, or even upward. In addition, the direction of “down” may vary from place to place within the plane.</p>
<p><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong>: The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity’s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but it is common on “weightless” planes.</p>
<p>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining “down” near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character “flies” by merely choosing a “down” direction and “falling” that way. Under such a procedure, an individual “falls” 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one’s movement by changing the designated “down” direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter).</p>
<p>It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id59">4.1.1.1.3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time</a><a class="headerlink" href="#time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The rate at which time passes can vary on different planes, though it remains constant within any particular plane. Time is always subjective to the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various planes. Travelers may discover that they gain or lose time while moving between planes, but from their point of view, time always passes naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Normal Time</strong>: Describes how time passes on the Material Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals 1 hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted in a plane’s description, assume it has the normal time trait.</p>
<p><strong>Erratic Time</strong>: Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between such planes and any others. To the denizens of such a plane, time flows naturally and the shift is unnoticed. The following is provided as an example.</p>

<p><strong>Flowing Time</strong>: On some planes, the flow of time is consistently faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, and then return to the Material Plane to find that only 6 seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him, that year away was entirely real. When designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material Plane’s flow of time first, followed by the flow in the other plane.</p>
<p><strong>Timeless</strong>: On planes with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait affects certain activities or conditions such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane. The danger of a timeless plane is that once an individual leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging occur retroactively. If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a noninstantaneous duration is permanent until dispelled.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id60">4.1.1.1.4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shape and Size</a><a class="headerlink" href="#shape-and-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Planes come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Most planes are infinite, or at least so large that they may as well be infinite.</p>
<p><strong>Infinite</strong>: Planes with this trait go on forever, though they may have finite components within them. Alternatively, they may consist of ongoing expanses in two directions, like a map that stretches out infinitely. Unless otherwise noted in its description, assume that a plane is effectively infinite.</p>
<p><strong>Finite Shape</strong>: A plane with this trait has defined edges or borders. These borders may adjoin other planes or be hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Contained Shape</strong>: On planes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the traveler on the other side of the map. Some spherical planes are examples of self-contained, finite planes, but they can also be cubes, tori, or flat expanses with magical edges that teleport the traveler to the opposite edge when she crosses them. Some demiplanes are self-contained.</p>

<div class="section" id="morphic-traits">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id61">4.1.1.1.5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morphic Traits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#morphic-traits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can be changed. Some planes are responsive to sentient thought, while some respond to physical or magical efforts. Others can only be manipulated by extremely powerful creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Alterable Morphic</strong>: On a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they are) unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort. Unless otherwise noted in a plane’s description, assume it has the alterable morphic trait.</p>
<p><strong>Divinely Morphic</strong>: Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this trait. They may cause these areas to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves. Ordinary characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be affected by spells and physical effort.</p>
<p><strong>Highly Morphic</strong>: On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it’s difficult to keep a particular area stable. Some such planes may react dramatically to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Magically Morphic</strong>: Specific spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</p>
<p><strong>Sentient</strong>: These planes respond to a single entity’s thoughts—those of the plane itself. Travelers might find the plane’s landscape changing as a result of what the plane thinks of the travelers, becoming either more or less hospitable depending on its reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Static</strong>: These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane or objects that the denizens posses. Any spells that would affect those on the plane have no effect unless the plane’s static trait is somehow removed or suppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane with the static trait remain in effect, however. Even moving an unattended object within a static plane requires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy objects may be impossible to move.</p>

<div class="section" id="elemental-and-energy-traits">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id62">4.1.1.1.6-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elemental and Energy Traits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#elemental-and-energy-traits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Four basic elements and two types of energy combine to make up everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and water; the types of energy are positive and negative. The Material Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies—all are found there. Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other planes may show off various aspects of these elemental traits. Many planes have no elemental or energy traits; such traits are noted in a plane’s description only when they are present.</p>
<p><strong>Air-Dominant</strong>: Consisting mostly of open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other solid matter. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect with. They take no actual damage, however.</p>
<p><strong>Earth-Dominant</strong>: Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they don’t reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth-dominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them, but suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</p>
<p><strong>Fire-Dominant</strong>: Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.</p>
<p>Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every round they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes. Those that are made of water take double damage each round.</p>
<p><strong>Water-Dominant</strong>: Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can’t breathe water or reach a pocket of air likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each round.</p>
<p><strong>Negative-Dominant</strong>: Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. There are two kinds of negative-dominant traits: minor negative-dominant and major negative-dominant. On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage per round. At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.</p>
<p>Major negative-dominant planes are even more dangerous. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The death ward spell protects a traveler from the damage and energy drain of a negative-dominant plane.</p>
<p><strong>Positive-Dominant</strong>: An abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. Like negative-dominant planes, positive-dominant planes can be either minor or major. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.</p>
<p>Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full hit points gain 5 additional temporary hit points per round. These temporary hit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive-dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, which kills it.</p>

<div class="section" id="alignment-traits">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id63">4.1.1.1.7-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alignment Traits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#alignment-traits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Some planes have a predisposition to a certain alignment. Most of the inhabitants of these planes also have the plane’s particular alignment, even powerful creatures such as deities. The alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who follow other alignments than most of the inhabitants do may have a tougher time dealing with the plane’s natives and situations.</p>
<p>Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can have a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific alignment trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident. Many planes have no alignment traits; these traits are noted in a plane’s description only when they are present.</p>
<p><strong>Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned</strong>: These planes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned.</p>
<p><strong>Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned</strong>: Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.</p>
<p><strong>Neutral-Aligned</strong>: These planes stand outside the conflicts between good and evil and law and chaos.</p>
<p><strong>Mildly Aligned</strong>: Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks. A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Strongly Aligned</strong>: On planes that are strongly aligned, a -2 circumstance penalty applies to all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane’s alignment. The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait stack.</p>
<p>A strongly neutral-aligned plane stands in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes apply a -2 circumstance penalty on Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks made by any creature that isn’t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a -2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a -4 penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="magic-traits">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id64">4.1.1.1.8-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Traits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#magic-traits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A plane’s magic trait describes how magic works on that plane compared to how it works on the Material Plane. Particular locations on a plane (such as those under the direct control of deities) may be pockets where a different magic trait applies.</p>
<p><strong>Normal Magic</strong>: This magic trait means that all spells and supernatural abilities function as written. Unless otherwise noted in a plane’s description, assume that it has the normal magic trait.</p>
<p><strong>Dead Magic</strong>: These planes have no magic at all. A plane with the dead magic trait functions in all respects like an antimagic field spell. Divination spells cannot detect subjects within a dead magic plane, nor can a spellcaster use teleport or another spell to move in or out. The only exception to the “no magic” rule is permanent planar portals, which still function normally.</p>
<p><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Particular spells and spell-like abilities are easier to use or more powerful in effect on planes with this trait than they are on the Material Plane. Natives of a plane with the enhanced magic trait are aware of which spells and spell-like abilities are enhanced, but planar travelers may have to discover this on their own. If a spell is enhanced, it functions as if its caster level was 2 higher than normal.</p>
<p><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Particular spells and spell-like abilities are more difficult to cast on planes with this trait, often because the nature of the plane interferes with the spell. To cast an impeded spell, the caster must make a concentration check (DC 20 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot. If the check succeeds, the spell functions normally.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Magic</strong>: Planes with this trait permit only the use of spells and spell-like abilities that meet particular qualifications. Magic can be limited to effects from certain schools or subschools, effects with certain descriptors, or effects of a certain level (or any combination of these qualities). Spells and spell-like abilities that don’t meet the qualifications simply don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Magic</strong>: On a plane with the wild magic trait, spells and spell-like abilities function in radically different and sometimes dangerous ways. Any spell or spell-like ability used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry. The caster must make a caster level check (DC 15 + the level of the spell or spell-like ability) for the magic to function normally. Failure means that something strange happens; roll d% and consult Table 7-16: Wild Magic Effects.</p>

<p>Aasimars are humans with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. Aasimars are not always good, but it is a natural tendency for them, and they gravitate to good faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can hide for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens. Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features are hair that shines like metal, unusual eye or skin color, or even glowing golden halos.</p>

<p>Aatheriexas were once a race of conquerors and slavers, but since the destruction of their homeworld, the survivors have wandered the cosmos. Exceedingly cruel, they find perverse pleasure in tormenting those they capture, using them as disposable bodyguards or subjecting them to sadistic magic experiments.</p>
<p>An aatheriexa’s fleshy pink center is roughly 2 feet in diameter, and features a maw of gnashing teeth. Its grasping eye-tentacles hang down like the leaves of a weeping willow and extend its effective diameter to 5 feet. Aatheriexas weigh approximately 150 pounds.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id72">6.3-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demon</a><a class="headerlink" href="#demon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Demons exist for one reason—to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy—for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon’s depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon’s lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.</p>
<p>Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as <a class="reference internal" href="#abyss-ce">Abyss</a>. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.</p>
<p>Known to many scholars as “proto-demons,” these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abbadon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows—a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.</p>
<p>The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Entropy itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal—pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.</p>
<p>Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners’ demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.</p>
<p>The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.</p>

<div class="section" id="daemon">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id73">6.4-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daemon</a><a class="headerlink" href="#daemon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Harbingers of ruin and embodiments of the worst ways to die, daemons epitomize painful death, the all-consuming hunger of evil, and the utter annihilation of life. While demons seek to pervert and destroy in endless unholy rampages, and devils vex and enslave in hopes of corrupting mortals, daemons seek only to consume mortal life itself. While some use brute force to despoil life or prey upon vulnerable souls, others wage campaigns of deceit to draw whole realms into ruin. With each life claimed and each atrocity meted out, daemons spread fear, mistrust, and despair, tarnishing the luster of existence and drawing the planes ever closer to their final, ultimate ruin.</p>
<p>Notorious for their hatred of the living, daemons are the things of dark dreams and fearful tales, as their ultimate ambitions include extinguishing every individual mortal life—and the more violent or terrible the end, the better. Their methods vary wildly, typically differentiated by daemonic breed. Many seek to infiltrate the mortal plane and sow death by their own taloned hands, while others manipulate agents (both mortal and immortal) as malevolent puppet masters, instigating calamities on massive scales from their grim realms. Such diversity of methods causes many planar scholars to misattribute the machinations of daemons to other types of fiends. These often deadly mistakes are further propagated by daemons’ frequent dealings with and manipulation of other outsiders. Yet in all cases, despair, ruin, and death, spreading like contagion, typify the touch of daemonkind, though such symptoms often prove recognizable only after the hour is far too late.</p>
<p>Daemons flourish upon the plane of Abbadon, a bleak expanse of cold mists, fearful shapes, and hunted souls. Upon these wastes, the souls of evil mortals flee predation by the native fiends, and terror and the powers of the evil plane eventually transform the most ruthless into daemons themselves. Amid these scarred wastelands, poison swamps, and realms of endless night rise the foul domains of the tyrants of daemonkind, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Lords of devastation, these powerful and unique daemons desire slaughter, ruin, and death on a cosmic scale, and drive hordes of their lesser kin to spread terror and sorrow across the planes. Although the Horsemen share a singular goal, their tactics and ambitions vary widely.</p>
<p>Along with mastery over vast realms, the Horsemen are served by unimaginably enormous armies of their lesser brethren, but are obeyed most closely by retinues of daemons enslaved to their titles. These specific strains of daemonic servitors, known among daemonkind as deacons, serve whoever holds the title of Horseman. Although these instruments of the archdaemons differ in strength and ability, their numbers provide their lords with legions capable of near-equal terrorization.</p>
<p>More so than among any other fiendish race, several breeds of daemons lust after souls. While other foul inhabitants of the planes seek the corruption and destruction of living essences, many daemons value possession and control over mortal animas, entrapping and hoarding souls—and in so doing disrupting the natural progression of life and perverting the quintessence of creation to serve their own terrible whims. While not all daemons possess the ability to steal a mortal being’s soul and turn it to their use, the lowliest of daemonkind, the maniacal cacodaemons, endlessly seek life essences to consume and imprison. These base daemons enthusiastically serve their more powerful kin, eager for increased opportunities to doom mortal spirits. While cacodaemons place little value upon the souls they imprison, greater daemons eagerly gather them as trophies, fuel for terrible rites, or offerings to curry the favor of their lords. Several breeds of daemons also possess their own notorious abilities to capture mortal spirits or draw upon the power of souls, turning the forces of utter annihilation to their own sinister ends.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id74">6.5-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protean</a><a class="headerlink" href="#protean" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Beings of pure chaos, the serpentine proteans slither through the anarchic improbabilities of Entropy, remaking reality according to their whims. According to their own history, before the Old Gods pulled forth the other planes from raw
chaos, the Void was the Whole, infinite. They dream of restoring the Entropy to its former state, and they have been battling against the indignity ever since.
Hereditary and ideological enemies of the lawful planes (The Tribunal, Heaven and Hell), and especially of the residents of those planes, all proteans see it as their sacred duty to return the reality to the original chaos, for the planes’ own good and for the greater glory of their mysterious god, a dualistic deity which may be a living aspect of Entropy itself. They are Entropy’s living, breathing immune system, rooting out infections of order and mundanity, and replacing them with beautiful entropy.</p>
<p>Primeval in shape and philosophy, proteans are the race that most perfectly embodies the twin aspects of creation and destruction (although certain aeons might contest this claim). Even their language is mutable, evolving so quickly that few outsiders can understand it without magical aid. Ecological study is nearly impossible, as reproduction can take a wide variety of forms, from sexual union to fission to spontaneous generation. Despite their deceptively similar natural appearances, the two things that truly unify the protean race are slavish devotion to their strange god and a fervent desire for the dissolution of reality as we know it.</p>
<p>Proteans are organized into several sub-races or castes, each with its own individual abilities and roles. Other proteans than the four presented here doubtless exist, but they do not interact with other races nearly to the extent that these four types do.</p>
<p>Voidworms: Disowned by greater proteans, who find these tiny beings shameful, voidworms nevertheless retain all the characteristics of true proteans, and are frequently found swimming through Entropy’s Void in vast schools or serving as spellcasters’ familiars.</p>
<p>Naunets: Possessing little in the way of culture, the powerful naunets are the most bestial of the true proteans, representing the lowest recognized caste. Naunets are the shock troops of the protean race, and patrol the borderlands between Entropy and other planes, seeking out lawful incursions and making daring, savage raids into the realms of their enemies.</p>
<p>Imenteshes: These cunning proteans seek to subvert the forces of order from within their own systems, whispering information and insinuations where they can do the most damage. Endlessly creative, they adore reforming the landscapes of Entropy to suit their fancies, but enjoy warping the vistas and creatures of other planes even more.</p>
<p>Keketars: Priest-kings and voices of Entropy itself, keketars rule their fellows in the name of their bizarre god. Though their forms are extremely mutable, keketars can always be recognized thanks to eyes that glow amber or violet and floating crowns of swirling and changing symbols that often appear above their heads. Organized into cabals called choruses, keketars seek only to understand and follow the will of entropy.</p>
