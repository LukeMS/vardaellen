<p>Vardaellen is a small, generic Campaign Setting for core PFRPG (100% under the Open Game License). It was intended to designed so that it could be used for multiple purposes. My my personal goal, however, was to create a complete set of PFRPG rules + a generic campaign setting that was safe to be used by softwares developers, including games developers. You can read more about the <a class="reference internal" href="#legal-motivations">Legal Motivations</a> and me <cite>throwing a tantrum about this whole thing at the PFRPG's forum</cite>, if you want. But you should probably just go on and read the <a class="reference external" href="https://lukems.github.io/vardaellen/">Vardaellen campaign setting</a></p>

<p>This looks like the Entropy plane! Don't worry, I was just brainstorming with myself but will clean this up soonish.</p>
</div>
<p>That is because, every time the word &quot;video game&quot; came around in the PFRPG's forum, the PFRPG's staff appeared to be intentionality vague or misleading, saying things like &quot;The PRD is mostly Open Game Content, but it's not 100%&quot; and &quot;consider speaking with an intellectual properties legal specialist&quot;.
For independent game developers like myself, being told to hire an intellectual properties legal specialist to check the content of something that was supposed to be <strong>open</strong>, showed that they were biased as to prevent the proliferation of electronic games using PFRPG/PRD - except the big ones that were able to purchase a license from them. And that goes completely against the spirit of OGL.
One could be brave enough to try his luck anyway and use the PRD anyway, but considering that the a big Corportation could bury you legally, even without a proper complaint, was enough reason not to follow that path.</p>
<p>When D&amp;D was released under the OGL, PFRPG was built upon it.
In the spirit of the OGL, the same way that D&amp;D was released trough a SRD, PFRPG did the same with its PRD.
But, unfortunately, not all of the content there is considered Open Game Content and, worst of all, there is no clear distinction about what is and what isn't.
D&amp;D's 3.5 SRD was <strong>very specific</strong> about what was Open Game Content and what wasn't: at the beginning of each rtf file (thats the clumsy format they released the SRD under, but let us not complain!) they cleary said:</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<span class="docutils literal">D:\Documents\luajit\dnf\docs\readme.rst</span>, line 26)</p>
<p>Unexpected indentation.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>

<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<span class="docutils literal">D:\Documents\luajit\dnf\docs\readme.rst</span>, line 27)</p>
<p>Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Also, there was a &quot;Legal.rtf&quot; that named what, specifically, was considered Product Identity:</dt>
<dd><p>&quot;The following items are designated Product Identity, as defined in Section 1(e) of the Open Game License Version 1.0a, and are subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7 of the OGL, and are not Open Content: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, D&amp;D, Playerâ€™s Handbook, Dungeon Master, Monster Manual, d20 System, Wizards of the Coast, d20 (when used as a trademark), Forgotten Realms, FaerÃ»n, proper names (including those used in the names of spells or items), places, Red Wizard of Thay, the City of Union, Heroic Domains of Ysgard, Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, Windswept Depths of Pandemonium, Infinite Layers of the Abyss, Tarterian Depths of Carceri, Gray Waste of Hades, Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, Nine Hells of Baator, Infernal Battlefield of Acheron, Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia, Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia, Twin Paradises of Bytopia, Blessed Fields of Elysium, Wilderness of the Beastlands, Olympian Glades of Arborea, Concordant Domain of the Outlands, Sigil, Lady of Pain, Book of Exalted Deeds, Book of Vile Darkness, beholder, gauth, carrion crawler, tanarâ€™ri, baatezu, displacer beast, githyanki, githzerai, mind flayer, illithid, umber hulk, yuan-ti.</p>
<p>All of the rest of the SRD is Open Game Content as described in Section 1(d) of the License.&quot;</p>

<p>If you read the <a class="reference external" href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/openGameLicense.html">PRD's license</a>
, and latter PFRPG was built upon it (and also released its core PRD under the same license),
At the moment only the textual part of it is available but, eventually, it will also contain all of the core rules in data formats (eg json) that can easily be used by your software.
Although I'm no artist myself but, should anyone be willing to draw illustrations that would also be released under the OGL, I will gladly link them on the rst/html versions of the document.
